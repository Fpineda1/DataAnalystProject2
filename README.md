# Data Analyst Project 2
Project 2 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program 

In this project I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it.

This dataset had over 100,000 different medical appointments with 12 different parameters for each appointment
first I wrangled and cleaned the data to make analysis of the dataset easier.
Then I completed some explority analysis to determine what factors increase the likehood that the patient was no-show at for the appointment.

Finally I drew conclusions about the what factors increased the likelyhood of a patient being a no-show.
